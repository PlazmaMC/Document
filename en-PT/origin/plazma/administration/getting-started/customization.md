# ðŸŽ¨ Userization

Using a modified server platform like Plazma instead of the official server platform provided by Mojang Studios
is because the most significant reason is the ability for **customization**.

Below are various ways to customize and utilize Plazma.

Plazma provides powerful configuration settings from game mechanics to mob attributes.
