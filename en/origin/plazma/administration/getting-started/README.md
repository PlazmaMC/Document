description: Learn how to create a server with Plazma.
---

# üëü Getting Started

To use Plazma reliably, the system must meet the following requirements.

|               | Minimum | Recommended |
| :-----------: | ------: | ----------: |
|  Architecture |     x64 |           - |
|      RAM      |     8GB |        16GB |
| Storage space |     1GB |         8GB |
|      JRE      |      17 |          21 |

For smooth configuration file editing, it is also recommended to install an editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

***

## 1. JRE Installation

As the name suggests, Minecraft: "Java" Edition is developed in Java, so it requires JRE[^1] to run.

Since Plazma is based on Mojang Studios' official server platform[^2], JRE must be installed to use Plazma.

### 1.1 Check for JRE

To check if JRE is installed on the system, type [`cmd /k java --version`](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] in the Run window and run it.

If the output is as follows, skip to [Step 2](setup.md#id-2).

{% code title="Correct Output" lineNumbers="true" %}

```log
openjdk 21.0.2 2024-01-16 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu21.32+17-CA (build 21.0.2+13-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu21.32+17-CA (build 21.0.2+13-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
```

{% endcode %}

If it does not output as above, or if it outputs as below, JRE is not installed or is too outdated, so you need to perform [Step 1.2](setup.md#id-1.2).

{% code title="JRE Not Installed" lineNumbers="true" %}

```log
'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

{% endcode %}

{% code title="JRE Too Old" lineNumbers="true" %}

```log
Unrecognized option: --version
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
```

{% endcode %}

### 1.2 JRE Installation

In this guide, we will use Azul Zulu as one of the [types of JRE](#user-content-fn-5)[^5].

After installation, redo [Step 1.1](setup.md#id-1.1) to verify that the installation is successful.

{% tabs %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}

1. First, download **JDK 21** in `.msi` format from [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-21-lts\&os=windows\&architecture=x86-64-bit\&package=jdk#zulu).
2. Run the downloaded installer and click `Next`.
3. After activating `Set JAVA_HOME variable` from the menu displayed in the center left of the window, click `Next`.
4. Click `Install` to complete the JRE installation.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS" %}

Download the **JDK 21** in `.dmg` format from [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-21-lts\&os=macos\&architecture=x86-64-bit\&package=jdk#zulu) and run the installation wizard to install JRE.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Debian/Ubuntu" %}

First, run the following command in the terminal to add Azul Zulu repository to APT.

```bash
sudo apt install gnupg ca-certificates curl --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests -y

curl -s https://repos.azul.com/azul-repo.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/azul.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/azul.gpg] https://repos.azul.com/zulu/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zulu.list
```

Then, install JRE by running the following command in the terminal.

```bash
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests -y zulu21-ca-jre-headless
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Fedora/RHEL" %}

You can install JRE by entering the following command.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu-repo-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm

sudo dnf install -y zulu21-ca-jre-headless
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## 2. Plazma Download

Plazma offers various forms of executable files.

{% hint style="warning" %}

**In most cases, use `Reobf Paperclip`.**

The following information is for developers or those curious about the characteristics of each form.\
If you are a regular user, you can skip to [Step 3](setup.md#id-3) without any issues.

{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Learn More</summary>

The executable file is named `plazma-(version manager)-1.20.4-R0.1-SNAPSHOT-(mapping type).jar`.

- **Mapping Type**\
  Mapping is a kind of map that connects Minecraft's actual code with obfuscated code.
  - **Reobf**\

## 3. Creating a Start Script

To easily start Plazma and automatically restart the server, you need to create a [start script](#user-content-fn-6)[^6].

You can create a start script through [Flags.sh](https://flags.sh). By entering only the memory to be used for Plazma, the command will be automatically optimized.

You can download the start script by clicking the bottom left download button.\
**Make sure the downloaded start script matches your operating system.**

***

## 4. File Cleanup

Now move the downloaded start script and Plazma to a new folder.

{% hint style="warning" %}

**The folder name must not contain spaces and must be in English.**

Otherwise, Plazma or JRE may not function correctly.

{% endhint %}

Now run the start script. For Windows, <mark style="background-color:orange;">in the firewall permission prompt, make sure to select **Allow**</mark>.

***

## 5. EULA Agreement

Once you run the start script, an `eula.txt` file will be generated in the folder.

EULA[^9] is a license agreement that you must agree to by using the services of [Mojang Studios](#user-content-fn-10)[^10].

If you do not agree to the EULA, you cannot start the server, and violating the EULA may result in sanctions such as account suspension.

To agree to the EULA, change `eula=false` to `eula=true` in the `eula.txt` file and save it.

***

## 6. Allow External Connections (Windows)

Modern operating systems block external access by default to prevent unauthorized access from outside using **firewalls** and **routers**.

For Windows, since you allowed it in [Step 3](setup.md#id-3), you just need to do port forwarding.

{% hint style="info" %}

**This guide assumes the use of Windows operating system and a router that supports [UPnP](#user-content-fn-12)[^12].**

If your router does not support UPnP, you will need to search for information as panel layouts vary by router.

Alternatively, you can use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to generate a temporary address.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}

**For Linux or macOS (Unix-like) operating systems, firewall configuration methods vary by service, so you need to search for information directly.**

{% endhint %}

### 6.1 Check the Need for Port Forwarding

Enter the following in the Run window and run it.

```batch
powershell -noexit -c "((Get-NetIPConfiguration).IPv4Address).IPAddress -eq (Invoke-WebRequest "ifconfig.me").content"
```

If the output is `True`, you can stop here, but if it is `False`, you need to set up port forwarding.

### 6.2 Connect to the Server

{% tabs %}

{% tab title="Accessing from External" %}

If port forwarding is not needed or has already been successfully set up, you can now connect to the server.

The address used to connect to the server can be checked [here](https://ip.pe.kr/)

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Attempting port forwarding with UPnP" %}

In the `purpur.yml` of the server folder, enable `network.upnp-port-forwarding` to `true`.

Then, when you restart the server, Plazma will automatically attempt port forwarding.

Below is the indication of UPnP success based on the message output to the console, which will be displayed as `[UPnP] (message)` in the console.

| Message                           | Meaning                                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Successfully opened port (port)` | Port forwarding successful.                   |
| `Port (port) is already open`     | Another service is currently using that port. |
| `Failed to open port (port)`      | Port forwarding failed.                       |
| `Service is unavailable`          | The router does not support UPnP.             |

When the server shuts down, Plazma automatically closes the port.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Creating temporary address with Ngrok" %}

Using Ngrok is useful for short-term testing, collaborative play, or playing with friends.

1. Download the `Windows (64-bit)` ZIP file from [Ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. Put the downloaded Ngrok into the server folder.
3. Generate an authentication token at [Ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)[^13].
4. Execute the command displayed in the `Command Line` in the server folder.
5. Add `start /b ngrok tcp --region jp 25565` at the top of the execution script, and `taskkill /f /t /im ngrok.exe` at the bottom.
6. In the console, the address `0.tcp.jp.ngrok.io:12345` shown at the top will be the server's address.
7. Now you can connect from external sources using this address.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Connecting from local" %}

If you are trying to connect to the server from local, you can connect using the `IPv4 address` output from running `cmd /k ipconfig` in the command prompt.

For example, if the output displays as follows after executing the command,

```log
Windows IP Configuration

Ethernet Adapter Ethernet:

    Connected DNS Suffix. . . . :
    IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . : 192.168.3.7
    Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
    Default Gateway . . . . . . : 192.168.3.1

```

When attempting to connect to the server locally, you can connect using the `192.168.3.7` displayed in the IPv4 address here.

If the server and the game are running on the same PC, you can connect using `localhost`.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## 7. Evolution Stage

If the server starts successfully and is operating correctly, it is time to customize the server.

Learn how to customize the server through the guide below.
