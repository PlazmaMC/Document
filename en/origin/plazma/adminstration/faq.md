### A warning is displayed every time the server starts

Plazma contains some unstable patches and may always malfunction, so the server displays the following warning when it starts.

```log
[12:34:56 WARN]: Warning! Plazma may cause unexpected problems, so be sure to test it thoroughly before using it on a public server.
```

This warning can be disabled using the [`-DPlazma.iKnowWhatIAmDoing`](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] system property.

Refer to the following page for more details.
