# ‚ùì What is Plazma?

- **Plazma** is a server platform based on [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) that takes only the advantages of [Andromeda](https://github.com/EarendelArchived/Andromeda) and [Fusion](https://github.com/RuinedTechnologyUnify/Fusion).
- We are always striving to provide high stability, powerful performance, fast updates, and extensive features.

## üìã Goals of Plazma <a href="#id-1" id="id-1"></a>

- We are working hard to become a server platform with fast updates and high stability.
- We are striving to provide extensive features and powerful performance comparable to mod platforms.
- We are working towards creating a free platform that allows customization of vanilla patches.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features <a href="#id-2" id="id-2"></a>

1. **Strong Plugin Ecosystem**\
   Based on [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper),
   most of the [latest plugins](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] available for download on the internet work properly.
2. **Optimization Without Setup**\
   Containing all patches from [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish) and
   some built-in optimizations and modes, it provides the best performance.
3. **Customize Your Game as You Like**\
   [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur) included in Plazma allows you to modify
   various attributes of the game.
4. **Play on Servers Safely**\
   With [No Chat Reports](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports) included, you can disable
   [Mojang](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]'s [chat reporting system](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] added since 1.19,\
   and the diagnostics collector is completely removed, allowing you to play on a traceless safe server.
5. **Fastest updates**\
   [AlwaysUpToDate](https://github.com/PlazmaMC/AlwaysUpToDate) ensures that Plazma's included patches are always kept up to date, providing the fastest updates among Paper-based server platforms.
6. **Optimized default configuration files**\
   The default configuration files are optimized, eliminating the need for manual optimization.
7. **Systematically functioning multithreading**\
   Asynchronously synchronizing system mechanisms unrelated to game mechanics to reduce [latency](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] and optimize the server.
8. **Blocking unnecessary space usage**\
   Consolidating data with similar values reduces memory usage.

## ‚ú® Use Cases <a href="#id-3" id="id-3"></a>

- **Platform Handling Complex Plugins Correctly**\
  Plazma is used on developer [IPECTER](https://github.com/IPECTER)'s server.\
  With its own plugins that work with NMS and reflection, and a large number of complex and extensive data packs applied,\
  it can handle over 100 players without performance degradation.
- **Maintaining Fast Performance on RPG Servers**\
  Stably maintaining 100 players on a single cluster without TPS drops, and allowing a total of 250 players to play comfortably on 4 clusters.
- **Platform Revealing Light in Chunks/Entities**\
  By switching from Purpur to Plazma on a survival server where delays occurred in processing chunks and entities,
  most delays could be reduced.
- **Platform Chosen by Many Streamers**\
  Being chosen as the bucket for many streamers' viewer participation.
